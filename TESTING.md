## Automated Testing
### Responsivity across devices
* As a user, I want the website to be responsive across all devices
This test allowed me to ensure the user story for responsivity was met
    - I checked the site across [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ie/chrome/), [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) 
    and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) and all pages were completely responsive  with the layout remaining intact.
    - Using [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools), (to open I right-clicked anywhere on my website and clicked "Inspect" or clicked "F12" on the keyboard), I ran my site in mobile/tablet display 
    across the following devices: Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy S III, Moto G4, iPhone 4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 5/SE, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro. Everything 
    ran normally on these devices. 
    I also sent my site to some friends and family to open on their phones.
