# Energy Gym

The live version of the site is available [here]()

This project was created for my fourth and final Milestone Project with Code Institute in order to display my knowledge and understanding 
of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django, MySQL and Stripe payments.

I remember I really wanted to create a website for a gym for my first project but I held out until now to complete it so I could add the features I wanted to add and have it looking as professional as possible. As someone who is equally passionate about fitness and technology, I know the huge effect a good website can have on the perception of your business. Down the line, I would love to be able to open my own fitness studio so this project is going to be the first step in acheiving that goal. I want this site to be simple and sleek with strong images and minimal text. This site will be the place users come to sign up easily and be able to purchase their membership option as well as book in for classes. The members will also be able to leave reviews on the classes to create a community feel where feedback is always appreciated.
